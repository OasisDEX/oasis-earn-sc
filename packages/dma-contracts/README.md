# @oasisdex/dma-contracts

## Deploying contracts
Decide which network you want to deploy to. The following networks are supported:
- `local` - local hardhat node
- `mainnet` - mainnet
- `goerli` - goerli testnet
- `optimism` - optimism mainnet
- `arbitrum` - arbitrum mainnet

Then run the following command:
```bash
yarn hardhat run scripts/deployment/deploy-<network-name>.ts --network <network-name>
```

If the network is a protected network you will be asked to confirm the action.

Finally, please review the configs in @oasisdex/deploy-configurations to see which contracts have the deploy flag set to `true`. 
Only contracts with the deploy flag set to `true` will be deployed.

For more info see the deployment configs [readme](../deploy-configurations/README.md).

After deployment, the addresses of the deployed contracts will be saved directly in the deployment configs.

## Add Operation Definitions to OperationRegistry

Currently, the GnosisSafe integration is not working so additions are manual.

To assist this process you can log out the Operation Definition using the logOp helper in `scripts/deployment/deploy.ts`

Here are the steps to log out Operation Definitions to console:
* Find the appropriate config for the network you're deploying for
* Mark both ServiceRegistry and OperationsRegistry for deployment (deploy: true)
* Ensure that the log flag is set to true for each OpDefinition you want to log out
* Ensure that your chosen script has a function call such as `await ds.addOperationEntries()` and it's not commented out
* Run the script against a local node eg `yarn hardhat run scripts/deployment/deploy-mainnet.ts` (without network specified which will default to Hardhat)
* When run locally the addOperationEntries script will update network to use the network fork (in this case mainnet)

## Symlink contracts before Using @dma-contracts
You need to create a symlink, to include `ajna-contracts` in `dma-contracts` for proper solc compilation.
```bash
/oasis-earn-sc/packages/dma-contracts$ ln -s ~/absolute_path_to_the_repository/oasis-earn-sc/packages/ajna-contracts/contracts/ajna ./contracts/
```

You can also run the following script to create the symlink from the project root
```
yarn symlink
```

## Circular dependencies

Some HH Tasks in @dma-contracts depend on the library.
A special script has been created to run these tasks
```bash
yarn hardhat run scripts/run-dependent-task.ts --network local
```

Please do not import tasks that are dependent on @dma-library into hardhat.config.ts
